# Image-Classification-Using-Vision-Transformer-ViTs
Vision Transformers (ViTs) are a class of neural network architectures originally proposed for image classification tasks. They represent a departure from traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have dominated computer vision tasks for years. ViTs leverage the Transformer architecture, which gained fame in natural langua
